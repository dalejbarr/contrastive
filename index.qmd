- visual-world eyetracking, 24 participants and 20 displays
- main manipulation of *contextual support* for the size adjective: contrast was replaced with an unrelated object (file folder)
- main finding: addressees identify the target prior to noun onset when contrastive interpretation was contextually supported

::: {.notes}
given 64 trials / cond, a difference of .05 in target looks means that there were just 3 more trials with looks to the target in one condition than in another

- target advantage ratio $\frac{T}{T + C}$

- reported as replicating Sedivy et al. ($p < .05$); but actually didn't [$p_1 = `r .pa`$, $p_2 = `r .pb`$]
- reliable interaction between number of contrasts and ground, $p_1 = `r .p1`$, $p_2 = `r .p2`$
- reliable difference between two-privileged and two-shared, $p_1 = `r .pc`$, $p_2 = `r .pd`$

- noisy data (difference of .1 = 6 trials!)

**Methods**
:::

- 32 participants
- 48 stimulus items
- 48 fillers
- 1,536 trials (384 per condition)
  - (.1 difference = 38 trials)
- EyeLink 1000 remote eyetracker (250Hz)

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.center}
**Analysis**
:::

- *pre-registered analysis*
  - cluster-permutation analysis of eyetracking data (log ratio) from -400 to 200 ms after noun onset
- additional analysis
  - accuracy on filler trials
  - response time

- LME with maximal random effects and LRT
- no main effect of speaker, $\chi^2(1) = .48, p = .489$

- speaker-by-addressee interaction, $\chi^2(1) = 12.26, p < .001$
  - follow up: two mismatching conditions slower than the late/late condition, $\chi^2(1) = 8.98, p = .003$

## Discussion

- Sedivy et al. not fully replicated under a more stringent test
- Heller et al. also not replicated; mismatching perspectives showed *slower* responses and target looks than even the late/late conditions
- but: is there a confound of cognitive load?

## Everyone is wrong

Under perspectival conflict, addressees...

- could not effectively use a speaker's perspective to resolve temporary ambiguity (Heller, Grodner, Tanenhaus, 2008)
- did *not* constrain comprehension to common ground (Clark & Carlson, 1981) 
- were *not* egocentric (Keysar, Barr et al. 2000, 2003)
- did not simultaneously integrate multiple perspectives (Hanna, Tanenhaus, Trueswell, 2003; Heller, Parisien, Stevenson, 2016)

## Pragmatic deferral

When perspectives are known to conflict, addressees adopt a cautious mode in which normal pragmatic inferences are suspended and they wait for disambiguating information?

Perhaps our results reflect an inability to simultaneously maintain multiple conflicting perspectives in mind?

(to be continued... someday...)
